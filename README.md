# Security-Analysis-Data-Parser
A Jquery built system to read object information and store to be accessed by various functions for a web panel and terminal.

Built in a user can search for exploits/topis on anything regarding their tags. These tags can be sorted via Operating System, Name, Topic, or Underlying System (eg. DNS)

If a user desides they do not wish to view through a terminal they may use the built in web menu which contains the same information as the temrinal sorted in the same format for ease of use.

Known Issues:
Scoll functionality missing

This project uses Jquery Terminal for the core console functionality along with Bootstrap for CSS and HTML formatting.
